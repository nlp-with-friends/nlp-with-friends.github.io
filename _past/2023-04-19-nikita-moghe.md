Automatic machine translation (MT) metrics are widely used to distinguish the quality of machine translation systems across relatively large test sets (system-level evaluation).
However, it is unclear if automatic metrics are reliable at distinguishing good translations from bad translations at the sentence level (segment-level evaluation). We first investigate how useful MT metrics are at detecting the segment-level quality by correlating metrics with the translation utility for downstream tasks - They are not! In the second part, we take a more holistic view of this investigation by evaluating 22 MT metrics on a contrastive challenge set consisting of 68 phenomena ranging from simple perturbations at the word/character level to more complex errors based on discourse and real-world knowledge. We find that metrics tend to disregard source sentences and fail at ambiguous translations. Further, even neural metrics are considerably influenced by word overlap with the reference; and some properties of multilingual embeddings produce undesirable effects for MT evaluation.
