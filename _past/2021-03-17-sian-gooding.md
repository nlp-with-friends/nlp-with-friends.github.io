<a href="https://lolmythesis.com/" class="one-line">Talking about the importance of text simplification using complex academic language. </a>

The difficulty of a text is highly subjective, yet this factor is often neglected in text simplification and readability systems which use a “one-size-fits-all" approach. In this talk, I will discuss what contributes to text complexity, emphasising how this is dependent on the intended audience. Furthermore, I will present work showing how on-device reading strategies also differ based on a reader’s first language and proficiency.
