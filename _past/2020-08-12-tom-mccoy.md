Despite their impressive scores on NLP leaderboards, current neural models fall short of humans in two major ways: They require massive amounts of training data, and they generalize poorly to novel types of examples. To address these problems, we propose an approach for giving linguistic inductive biases to a model, where *inductive biases* are factors that affect how a learner generalizes. Our approach imparts inductive biases using *meta-learning*, a procedure through which the model discovers how to acquire new languages more quickly via exposure to many possible languages. By controlling the properties of the languages used during meta-learning, we can control the inductive biases that meta-learning imparts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a case study from phonology.
