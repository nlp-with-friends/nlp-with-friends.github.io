## What makes a good talk?
A good talk both educates and sparks insightful discussion – it does *not* need to be polished!
Some points you might consider discussing: 
- Something you might not learn from the paper
- Something you found particular interesting, even if not the main point
- The steps along the way to discovering the final idea or method
- What *didn’t* work
- What open questions and possible extensions are you interested in addressing in future work?


## Community Guidelines

We seek to foster a friendly, inclusive, and welcoming environment that allows presenters and audience alike to enjoy a freedom to ask questions without concern for reputation, something else, and something else. 
For this reason, all discussions after the presentation will follow the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule). 
Further, we ask all participants and speakers follow our code of conduct. 

We believe that one of the nice things about talks is that they end.
This means, that although questions can be posed to the speaker after the talk has concluded, we ask that all questions are posed to the speaker by midnight (UTC-12) of the day of the talk, to allow the speaker to conclude their talk.
