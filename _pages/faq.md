## When do we meet?
Every week or two on Wednesdays for one hour. We alternate between three times: [12:00 am UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200805T000000&p1=224&p2=179&p3=136&p4=676&p5=33&p6=152), [8:00 am UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200805T080000&p1=224&p2=179&p3=136&p4=676&p5=33&p6=152) and [14:00 am UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200805T140000&p1=224&p2=179&p3=136&p4=676&p5=33&p6=152), to allow people from different places to be able to join and engage the discussion. Click on each time to see time zone conversions to your area (and note the possible dateline change -- for some time zones, it may be Tuesday!) 

## Where do we meet?
On Zoom! In order to avoid [zoom-bombing](/assets/zoom-bomb.png), we will send the zoom-invite through email.

## Who’s speaking next?
Check out our [upcoming speakers list](/upcoming)!

## Are the seminars recorded?
Yes! But just the talks themselves (and any questions asked *during* the presentation) will be recorded.
The discussions following talks will not be recorded, in order to encourage discussion and remove hesitations about question-asking. 
Recorded talks can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zsOCvKa2iEqmPV6WGhjuP-tsrUy102C). Or, check out the [Past](/past) section to watch a specific talk.

## Is there a code of conduct? How will zoom-bombing or other misbehavior be handled? 
Yes! See our [community guidelines](/guidelines/#community-guidelines).
