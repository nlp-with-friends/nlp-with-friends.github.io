This is the home of **NLP with Friends**, 
an **online seminar series** made by students, for students, where everyone is invited!

## ðŸ“¢ **Call for Speakers!**
We're looking for speakers to share their knowledge at our upcoming event. Nominate a colleague or apply to speak yourself - let's talk all things NLP and learn together! 
> [**Apply here!!**](https://t.co/cjgsZ7sleA)


## <i class="fas fa-fw fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i>&nbsp; About the Seminar

We meet [**Wednesdays**](/faq/#when-do-we-meet) on a bi-weekly basis to talk about interesting work in NLP and related areas. The presenters are [**students**](/faq/#who-are-our-speakers), who will talk about their **own work** (both ongoing and already published). Links are distributed through our [**mailing list**](/faq/#how-do-i-join-the-mailing-list).

The idea for this setting is to be a supportive and engaging environment for students to present their work and discuss work with other students and researchers around the world. 
Following each talk (or during, if the presenter allows) there will be time to ask questions, discuss relevant topics, and wonder about what's next.
We expect everyone to follow our [**code of conduct**](/code-of-conduct) to make this a respectful forum.
The official language of the seminar is English.

We hope this format will foster greater kinship between students around the globe, provide students greater access to seminars and experience presenting, create a judgement-free forum in which to ask questions, and give us all a chance to learn from each other -- both successes and failures!

We are committed to diversity of topics and presenters; we hope to connect students all over the world, and give the stage to a range of topics and speakers.
